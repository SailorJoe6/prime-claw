# prime-claw Developer Guide

For contributors working on the prime-claw builder repo.

## Prerequisites

- Git, Bash, standard Unix utilities
- Python 3 + pytest (for the script/test layer)
- beads CLI (`bd`)
- prime-agent (the harness this project builds on)
- Optional: gbrain CLI (for brain/source work)
- Optional: Docker/Podman (for sandbox runtime work, later phases)

## Layout

- `VISION.md` / `LONG_RANGE_PLAN.md` — founding vision and long-range plan
- `docs/` — design docs; `docs/lineage/` — distilled prior-art notes
- `scripts/` — `apply-*` (mutate), `check-*` (readiness), `validate-*`
  (acceptance), `run-*` (smoke), plus helpers
- `tests/` — pytest coverage for scripts and contracts
- `config/` — manifests, including requirements inventory
- `templates/` — prime-agent skill and config templates

## Engineering discipline

Every capability follows the apply/check/validate/test pattern proven in
openclaw-setup:

1. A design doc in `docs/` states the requirement and decision.
2. `scripts/apply-*.sh` performs the mutation (idempotent where possible).
3. `scripts/check-*.sh` is a non-mutating readiness gate (exit 0 = ready).
4. `scripts/validate-*.py` proves live acceptance.
5. `tests/test_*.py` gives regression coverage.
6. `config/requirements-inventory.json` records the requirement and its
   coverage tier, so every requirement is traceable to a test.

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -q
```

Prove a new test can fail before trusting it: add the assertion, run it
against the pre-fix state, confirm it goes red, then fix.

## Local-state rules

- Never commit credential material.
- `.env` files are local; `.env.example` files are the committed templates.
- beads data lives under `.beads/` and syncs via `bd sync`.
